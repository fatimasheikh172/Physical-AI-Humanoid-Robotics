# Module 04: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Introduction

Welcome to Module 04 of the AI-Native Robotic Education curriculum! This module introduces the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework, which integrates voice recognition, large language model-based planning, and robotic action execution to enable natural human-robot interaction.

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework represents the convergence of three critical AI technologies:

1. **Vision Processing**: Real-time object recognition and scene understanding
2. **Language Understanding**: Natural language processing for command interpretation
3. **Action Execution**: Translation of high-level commands to robotic actions

This module will teach you how to build systems that allow users to interact with robots naturally through voice commands like "Go to the kitchen and bring me the red cup."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Implement voice recognition systems using OpenAI Whisper
- Design cognitive planning architectures with LLMs
- Integrate action execution with ROS 2 systems
- Combine perception and action in a cohesive pipeline
- Build end-to-end VLA systems for robot control

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main weeks:

- **Week 1**: Focus on voice recognition and cognitive planning
- **Week 2**: Implementation of action execution and vision perception
- **Week 3**: Capstone project integrating all components

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completion of Module 1-3
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of neural networks and LLMs
