# Week 1: Voice Recognition & Cognitive Planning

This week focuses on implementing voice recognition capabilities and cognitive planning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate natural language commands into actionable plans.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Set up voice recognition using OpenAI Whisper API
- Process natural language commands through LLMs
- Generate executable action plans from voice commands
- Integrate voice recognition with cognitive planning modules

## Topics Covered

### 1. Voice Recognition with OpenAI Whisper
- Setting up OpenAI API access
- Implementing voice command processing
- Audio preprocessing and noise reduction
- Voice activity detection

### 2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs
- Large Language Model integration
- Prompt engineering for robotic tasks
- Action decomposition and sequencing
- Safety validation for planned actions

### 3. Voice-to-Plan Pipeline
- Connecting voice recognition to cognitive planning
- Planning context with robot capabilities
- Error handling in the pipeline
- Performance optimization

## Implementation

This week involves creating the foundational components for the VLA system:

1. Voice command processing infrastructure
2. LLM-based cognitive planning module
3. Action sequencing pipeline
4. Integration between voice and planning components

## Required Reading

Before starting this week's implementation, review:
- OpenAI Whisper API documentation
- ROS 2 action client/server patterns
- LLM prompting best practices
- Robot capability specifications
