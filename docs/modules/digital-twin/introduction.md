# Module 02: Digital Twin for Robotic Systems

## Overview

This module introduces you to creating a digital twin pipeline for robotic systems. You'll learn to combine Gazebo for physics-accurate simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction. The implementation includes simulation of dynamics, sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU), perception pipelines, and synchronization between Gazebo and Unity for visualization and human-in-the-loop testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Set up and configure a physics-accurate simulation environment in Gazebo
2. Integrate various sensor models (LiDAR, depth camera, IMU) in simulation
3. Establish communication between Gazebo and Unity using ROS 2
4. Create synchronized visualization in Unity that mirrors Gazebo state
5. Implement perception algorithms that process simulated sensor data
6. Analyze simulation fidelity and optimize physics parameters
7. Package and distribute the complete digital twin system
