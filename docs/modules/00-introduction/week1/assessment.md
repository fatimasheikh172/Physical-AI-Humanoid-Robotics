## Written Response Questions

### Question 6: (15 points)
Explain the concept of "embodied intelligence" in your own words. What are the key principles, and why is this concept important for Physical AI? Provide at least one example to illustrate your explanation.

### Question 7: (15 points)
Compare and contrast the evolution from industrial robots to service robots to humanoid robots. What are the key differences in their capabilities, applications, and interaction models? How does this evolution reflect changing needs and technologies?

### Question 8: (10 points)
Explain the "Digital Brain vs Physical Body" concept. Why is it important to integrate both components for effective Physical AI systems? What challenges arise when connecting digital intelligence to physical actions?

## Application Question

### Question 9: (20 points)
Imagine you are designing a humanoid robot for a specific application (e.g., hospital assistance, elderly care, education). Describe what sensors you would include and explain how each sensor would contribute to the robot's ability to perform its function effectively in a real-world environment.

Consider:
- What environment will the robot operate in?
- What tasks will it need to perform?
- What sensory information will it need to gather?
- How will different sensors work together?
