# Week 1 Mini Project: Real-World Robot Analysis

## Objective
Select a real-world humanoid robot and analyze its design, sensors, AI system, and physical capabilities.

## Instructions
Choose one of the following real-world humanoid robots (or another with instructor approval):
- Boston Dynamics Atlas
- Tesla Optimus
- SoftBank Pepper
- Honda ASIMO
- Samsung Bot Handy
- Sanctuary AI Phoenix
- Engineered Arts Ameca

## Project Components
Write a concept report (500-800 words) addressing the following points:

### 1. Robot Overview
- Name and manufacturer
- Primary purpose/function
- Physical characteristics (height, weight, degrees of freedom)
- Key features that distinguish it from other robots

### 2. Sensors Used
Identify and describe at least 4 sensor types used by the robot:
- What function does each sensor serve?
- How do these sensors enable the robot to interact with the environment?
- What challenges might arise from limitations in sensor accuracy or range?

### 3. AI System Used
Analyze the robot's AI and control systems:
- What type of AI or control system does it use?
- How does it process sensor data to make decisions?
- What are the limitations of its current AI capabilities?
- Is it cloud-connected, edge-based, or fully autonomous?

### 4. Physical Actions Performed
Describe the primary physical tasks this robot can perform:
- Locomotion capabilities (walking, running, climbing stairs)
- Manipulation capabilities (gripping, lifting, fine motor control)
- Social interaction capabilities (gestures, expressions, speech)
- Environmental interaction (using tools, opening doors, carrying objects)

### 5. Applications and Use Cases
- What environments or situations is it designed for?
- What tasks is it specifically designed to perform?
- What are the advantages of a humanoid form for these applications?
- What are the limitations?

### 6. Critical Analysis
- What are the robot's biggest strengths in terms of Physical AI?
- What are the main challenges or limitations you observe?
- How well does it embody the principles of embodied intelligence?
- What improvements would you suggest?
