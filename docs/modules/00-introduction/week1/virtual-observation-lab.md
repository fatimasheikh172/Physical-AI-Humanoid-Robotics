# Virtual Robot Observation Lab

## Objective
This lab provides virtual observation of humanoid robots to help you understand their structure, capabilities, and applications in real-world scenarios.

## Required Materials
- Computer with internet access
- Video player capable of handling high-definition content

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Observe Humanoid Robot Videos
Watch the following videos of humanoid robots in action:

1. **Boston Dynamics - Atlas Robot**
   - Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQpRz8
   - Note the robot's mobility, balance, and dynamic movements

2. **Tesla - Optimus Robot**
   - Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... 
   - Observe the humanoid form factor and basic manipulation

3. **SoftBank - Pepper Robot**
   - Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
   - Notice the interaction capabilities and social features

### Task 2: Identify Sensors and Actuators
For each robot in the videos, try to identify:

#### Sensors
- **Cameras**: Look for lens-like components for vision
- **LiDAR**: Rotating or static units that scan the environment
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: Internal sensors for balance and orientation
- **Force/Torque sensors**: In joints or hands for feedback about forces applied
- **Microphones**: For audio input and communication
- **Tactile sensors**: In hands or skin to sense touch

#### Actuators
- **Motors in joints**: For movement (legs, arms, head)
- **Grippers/Hands**: For manipulation
- **Wheels or legs**: For locomotion
- **Speakers**: For audio output

### Task 3: Mapping Human Senses to Robot Sensors
Complete the following mapping between human senses and robot sensory capabilities:

| Human Sense | Robot Equivalent | Purpose |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Vision | Cameras, depth sensors | Object recognition, navigation |
| Hearing | Microphones | Speech recognition, audio localization |
| Touch | Tactile sensors, force/torque sensors | Object handling, safety |
| Balance | IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) | Stability, orientation |
| Proprioception | Joint encoders | Awareness of body position |

## Lab Report
After completing the observations, prepare a short report (1-2 paragraphs) that answers:
1. Which robot demonstrated the most human-like capabilities? Why?
2. What sensors did you observe in multiple robots?
3. What differences did you notice between robots designed for different tasks?

## Discussion Questions
1. How does the physical form of a robot affect its function?
2. What challenges do you think humanoid robots face in real-world environments?
3. Which human abilities do you think are most difficult to replicate in robots?
